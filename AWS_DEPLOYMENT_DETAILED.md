## üöÄ PHASE 2: Backend Deployment (EC2 + ECR)

### HUMAN TASKS:

1. **Get AWS Account ID**
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
   ```
   Save this number - we'll need it for ECR URLs.

2. **Create Key Pair**
   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name finsage-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > finsage-key.pem
   chmod 400 finsage-key.pem
   ```

### AI TASKS:

1. **Create ECR Repository**
   ```bash
   # I'll run this command for you
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name finsage-backend --region us-east-1
   ```

2. **Build and Push Docker Image**
   ```bash
   # I'll create and run this script
   ./scripts/deploy-backend.sh
   ```

3. **Create EC2 Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # I'll create security groups, launch EC2 instance, and configure it
   ./scripts/setup-ec2.sh
   ```

### HUMAN TASKS (After AI completes EC2 setup):

4. **SSH into EC2 Instance**
   ```bash
   ssh -i finsage-key.pem ec2-user@YOUR_EC2_PUBLIC_IP
   ```

5. **Verify Backend is Running**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/status/health
   ```

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-vpc.sh
   ```

2. **Create RDS Instance**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-rds.sh
   ```

3. **Update Backend Configuration**
   - I'll modify the backend to connect to RDS
   - Update environment variables

### HUMAN TASKS (After AI completes RDS setup):

2. **Test Database Connection**
   ```bash
   # I'll provide you with the connection test command
   ```

---

## üöÄ PHASE 4: Frontend Deployment (S3 + CloudFront)

### HUMAN TASKS:

1. **Choose S3 Bucket Name**
   - Must be globally unique
   - Example: `finsage-frontend-yourname-2024`

### AI TASKS:

1. **Build React Frontend**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-frontend.sh
   ```

2. **Create S3 Bucket and Upload**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-frontend.sh
   ```

3. **Create CloudFront Distribution**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-cloudfront.sh
   ```

### HUMAN TASKS (After AI completes frontend setup):

2. **Test Frontend**
   - Visit the CloudFront URL
   - Verify all features work

---

## üöÄ PHASE 5: Load Balancer & SSL

### AI TASKS:

1. **Create Application Load Balancer**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-alb.sh
   ```

2. **Configure SSL Certificate**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-ssl.sh
   ```

3. **Update DNS (if you have a domain)**
   - I'll provide instructions for domain setup

---

## üöÄ PHASE 6: Monitoring & Security

### AI TASKS:

1. **Set up CloudWatch Monitoring**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-monitoring.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Security Groups**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-security.sh
   ```

## üö® Emergency Contacts & Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong during deployment:

1. **Check AWS Console** for service status
2. **Review CloudWatch Logs** for application errors
3. **Verify Security Groups** are properly configured
4. **Test connectivity** between services

I'll provide specific troubleshooting commands for each phase.
